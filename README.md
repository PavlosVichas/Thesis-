Thesis Title ---- > CFD-aided layout optimization of a Blended Wing Body UAV configuration using a DoE and a novel geometry morphing technique.

This thesis is based on previous research conducted at the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Turbomachinery (LFMT) of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, concerning the optimization of Blended Wing Body (BWB) UAV configurations through parametric CAD modeling, the Taguchi design method and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools. Extending this work, this study utilizes new aerospace industry guidelines for mesh generation and uses mesh modeling techniques in preprocessor software (CFD) to create the same nine configurations used in the previous study. A comparative analysis is conducted between the results of the previous research, the results obtained from the configurations generated by the new approach to mesh generation, and the results of the configurations generated using mesh morphing techniques. Then, an optimization is carried out to identify the best configuration having as basic design parameters the weight, the maximum velocity and the damping factor ζ for the case of short-period dynamic characteristics (Short-Period). Beyond demonstrating the feasibility and potential advantages of mesh modeling as a geometry generation technique, and thus providing a strong alternative to CAD modeling, this research aspires to establish new guidelines and recommendations that can inform both current and future UAV design and optimization practices, thereby contributing to the advancement of the field
